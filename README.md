# Postgres_learning
process of learning Postgres

I am very fond of databases, and the first database that I learned was PostgreSQL. I continue to learn about it and make more progress. 

I built this project because I wanted to share things that I know and have feedbacks from others. Since many DBAs can help me throw 
learning these skills, I really wish to achieve feedback.
  
These documents also can help those who are learning Postgres for the first time.

I always try to share whatever I learn during my studies or work.
 
since these projects are explained very simple and also the environment is simple, steps would be really easy to execute and learn.:D
